# BioMonit

Project for the **Bachelor's Project** @ DETI-UA [2017].

Project done in collaboration with Miriam Cardoso, Jorge Loureiro, Gil Mesquita and Ana Cunha.

***

Goal was to create a platform to (1) monitor any type of sensor in real time and (2) present the measurements history. It includes management of several sensors at the same time (in any context), the management of permissions (relative to the sensors and their info) and the possibility to export the data.

> Using JavaPlay (aka Play Framework).
